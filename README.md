# Todo App Using Context and Local Storage

This is a Todo app project that I've created with a specific focus on learning how to use context and local storage for state management in a React application. In this project, I aimed to gain knowledge and experience in handling and storing data on the client side for various educational purposes.

## Functionality

- **Add a Todo**: You can add new tasks to your todo list.
- **Edit a Todo**: You have the ability to edit the text of an existing todo item.
- **Mark Todo as Completed**: To keep track of your progress, you can mark todo items as completed.
- **Delete a Todo**: When you no longer need a task, you can easily remove it from your list.

## Technologies and Dependencies Used

- **React (using Vite)**: The project is built using React and utilizes the Vite build tool for efficiency.
- **Context API from React**: The Context API is used for state management, allowing for a more organized and scalable application.
- **Local Storage**: Local storage is employed to persist todo data on the client side, ensuring data remains accessible even after refreshing the page.
- **Tailwind CSS for Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used to style the user interface, resulting in a clean and responsive design.

## Setting Up the Project Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:
